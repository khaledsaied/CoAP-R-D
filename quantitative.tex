\section{Quantitative Comparison}
Here goes the quantitative comparison.

\subsection{Bandwidth}
Measure number of bytes transferred between device and proxy.
More packet to send = more energy consumption

First experiment:
Single transaction (non-coap,con-coap,coap over tcp)

Second experiment:
Complete scenario (non-coap,con-coap,coap over tcp)


\subsection{Packet-loss}
Use the NetEM tool for emulating package-loss.
More lost packet = more packet to send = more energy consumption

\subsection{Latency}
Measure RTT values %which is the time from establishing the connection to receiving the acknowledgement.
More latency = less time to sleep = more energy consumption
