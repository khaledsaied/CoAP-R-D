\begin{abstract}
Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to consist of billions of devices by 2020. Constrained devices are an essential part of IoT and therefore the focus is on developing lightweight protocols enabling, among others, cloud communication. CoAP, a lightweight web transfer protocol, is developed in recent years and is already in use. A new version of CoAP has been proposed which presents a modified CoAP that runs over TCP instead of UDP. IoTivity has used CoAP before and has recently published a new version with CoAP over TCP implemented, specifically for cloud communication. In this paper a comparison between CoAP and CoAP over TCP is made focusing on the energy consumption by analysing the bandwidth and latency. A concrete case is given by calculating the energy consumption of the two versions of CoAP in an Arduino Due and a belonging Arduino WiFi Shield.
The evaluation of the results shows that CoAP over TCP has better energy performance than CoAP.
