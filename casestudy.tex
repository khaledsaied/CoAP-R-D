\section{Case Study} \label{sec:casestudy}
To better understand the results and which effect they can have on constrained devices, a concrete case is given with use of the Arduino WiFi Shield. This case will exemplify how much memory and energy the two CoAP versions will consume if used in an Arduino device.

\subsection{Memory}
For measuring the memory usage, an IoTivity CoAP implementation for Arduino is used. IoTivity currently does not support CoAP over TCP for Arduino and therefore the memory measurements are only made for an IoTivity CoAP implementation running on an Arduino Due.
 
%The memory consumption can only be made on the regular CoAP version as IoT is based on the implementation of IoTivity client applications 
The memory consumption are presented in table \ref{tab:memory}:
%TABLE
\begin{table}[bht]
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
	\caption{Memory Consumption in Arduino}
	\label{tab:memory}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\bfseries  & \bfseries IoTivity App (CoAP) & \bfseries IoTivity App (CoAP over TCP) \\
		\hline
		\textbf{RAM} & 3 kB & - kB \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Flash} & 95.18 kB & - kB \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The RAM measurements are done by using an AVR-tool called avr-size. The tool measures only the size of the initialized variables \cite{Check55:online}.

\subsection{Energy}
The bandwidth measurements can easily be converted to the amount of energy consumed by a specific device. For calculating the energy consumption, different factors has to be known. These are the energy consumption of the WiFi component (HDG204) in the WiFi shield both for transmitting and receiving data and the data rate of the WiFi component. These data are read from the datasheet for the HDG2014 component \cite{hdg204:datasheet}. The used WiFi component supports the standard 802.11.g which provides a rate up to 54 Mbit/s. It is however assumed that the rate for the transmissions is always 54 Mbit/s even though it can fluctuate. 


The calculations are shown below:

packet size/data rate  => time for  sending this packet
time for  sending this packet * transmit energy consumption
(6310/7077888)*590 = 0,5259902389 milli Joule

time for  sending this packet * receive energy consumption
(4232/7077888)*230 = 0,1375212493 milli Joule

%Energy calculation:
%watt = joule per second
%802.11.g <-- 54Mbit/per second (wireless rate) = 7077888 bytes/per second 
%590 mW - transmit energy consumption
%230 mW - receive energy consumption

%\textbf{En god ide er at maale energiforbruge / beregne det i joule. Giver et konkret svar om den kan bruges i specifikke typer af constraint devices}
