\section{Related Work}
A great amount of work has been done in comparing the transport protocols, TCP and UDP. 

In \cite{giannoulis2009tcp} a performance evaluation of TCP and UDP is done on wireless multihop networks. The results of the evaluation shows clearly that TCP is a more power consuming protocol than UDP. Moreover it shows that UDP is faster and can send more data packets than TCP.

%These comparisons all clearly shows that TCP is more secure than UDP  but at the same time that TCP has a bigger overhead and thereby is more consuming than UDP.

%Another area which is related is the comparison of  
Lightweight protocols are important for constrained environments, and the comparison of it has been in focus in recent research.

%	The comparison of lightweight communication protocols has received attention by recent literature work. In [11], Davis et al. reported on the performance comparison between MQTT- S [3], a specification of MQTT adapted to the characteristics of low-power WSN environment, and CoAP. Our previous work in [9] presented the comparison between CoAP and HTTP in WSNs and demonstrated how CoAP improves the performance of constrained devices such as sensors and actuators. In [12], high level features (such as messaging capabilities, security, reliability, availability of implementations...) of MQTT and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are evaluated and compared. A similar approach has been followed in [13] in order to compare MQTT and HTTP features. All the aforementioned comparisons of application protocols have not considered the use of smartphone but have only been limited in using lightweight application protocols in sensors and actuators. To the best of our knowledge, smartphone platforms have only been considered in [10], where Vergara et al describe a preliminary experimental evaluation of MQTT against HTTP. The comparison shows that the use of MQTT in Android devices decreases the energy consumption compared to HTTP in location based applications. To the best of our knowledge, the comparison between CoAP and MQTT has only been addressed in [6]. The comparison shows that CoAP lead to a lower bandwidth utilization as a consequence of the use of UDP instead of TCP as transport protocol. However, the comparison only considers the case in which the two protocols run on constrained battery operated gateways. They do not consider neither sensors and actuators nor smartphones. .
